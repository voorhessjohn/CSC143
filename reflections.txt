CSC143 Assignment 1

What is working:
This program will successfully encrypt and decrypt strings using the default rotor settings.
Both rotor rotation methods work correctly.
The user interaction is working.

What is not working:
The method to accept custom rotor settings is incomplete. 
The method to demonstrate encryption and decryption with sample strings is not implemented.
User input to accept strings for encryption and decryption is not validated. 
The user must use # for spaces and the input is not checked for validity of characters.
The return values are not formatted in a nice way.
The program is not commented.

Thoughts:
I spent too much time figuring out how to implement the rotor rotation.
Rotating the rotors at the wrong place in the nested for loops caused significant setbacks.
I mistakenly thought that I must set the rotor back to its last position after encryption
to decrypt a string. I was wrong. I was unable to give myself the time that this 
assignment warranted and my work suffered.

I would greatly appreciate more time to complete this assignment 
if doing so would earn me more credit.
